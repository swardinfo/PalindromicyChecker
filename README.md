## PalindromicyChecker

Click on releases to download the zip folder containing the program. The program is portable and so does not requie installation. Simply extract the executable file from the zip folder then right click it and select open from the menu.

Note: currently only a version for Windows 7 64 bit and above is available and .NET 5.0 runtime must be installed on the system.

The program tests and provides a partial proof of the conjecture that all lexicographically sorted matrices (L-Matrix) for any set, x = 0 to (base b ^ n) â€“ 1 where x, b and n are integers and b and n > 1 are comprised entirely of sets of rotated sequences that are in themselves or in pairs, palindromically isomorphic about the matrix median. This also holds true for all the permutations of any set base b and such a set is a palindromically distributed subset of an L-Matrix.

The programis limited to testing for L-Matrices of base = 2 to 10 and n = 2 to 10. The program can test full L-Matrices or just permutations. On my PC the combined tests takes about an hour.

'Palindromic structures in lexicographically sorted matrices - Ver 1.0.docx' outlines the observations I've made and the seven conjectures of which I have derived. It also includes the results of running PalindromicyChecker.

'Palindromic structures in lexicographically sorted matrices - Ver 1.0.xlsx' is an interactive workbook that domnstrates the conjctures from the word documnet.

'RNA as a Palindromic structure in lexicographically sorted matrices - Ver 1.0.xlsx' is another interactive workbook that demonstrates that any pair of DNA or RNA polynucleotide chains can be mapped to a lexicographically sorted matrices and will have the same properties as outlined in the word document.
